# Vagrant lubuntu Base
A base box for developer who prefer developing in a linux VM to windows. Uses Oracle Java 8 & Intellij.

Note this is a work in progress version which I have pushed in order to keep track of the state.

If you are MOJ search vagrant-lubuntu-base on internal confluence for info on how to customise further.

You will need the lubuntu base box.
